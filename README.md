EYES HERE >>> The .sql files are deprecated! They are not included in the base program. I have deleted them, but if you see one lying around, disregard it!


Ideally the database should be saved online using MySQL with a host, but most options with bigger storages and larger read/write capacity per month are paid. We make do with SQLite for now :(

DB Browsr for SQLite: https://download.sqlitebrowser.org/DB.Browser.for.SQLite-3.12.2-win64.msi
This will be your bestest friend when debugging the .db files.

Most of the pre-existing code I made were inefficiently implemented and the installation process isn't streamlined and, in-fact, very ugly. I made this program when my coding knowledge was still limited. My hopes to whoever befalls this project in its current state is that they could use this to identify and practice rectifying bad coding practices and have a go at making a better program than this.



I have attached the documentation file. It should have all the basic instructions for a user to install the program.
